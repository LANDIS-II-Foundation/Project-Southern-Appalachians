Readme Rx

To use the Rx maps Kate Jones created:https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Project-Southern-Appalachians-2018/tree/master/Parameterizing/Fire/Rx_data_processing.md
you need to adjust the number of annual fires to match the map you are using. Each map is weighted differently so that the State, local other, prescribed burning
can stay consistent with empirical estimates as the amount on national forests scales up and down. 


To simulate Rx where national forests meet 100% burn goals 
Rx_100percplan.tif with 150 annual Rx burns and an average size 30 cells

To simulate Rx where national forests meet 50% burn goals 
Rx_50percplan.tif with 94 annual Rx burns and an average size 30 cells

To simulate Rx where national forests meet 10% burn goals 
Rx_10percplan.tif with 49 annual Rx burns and an average size 30 cells
