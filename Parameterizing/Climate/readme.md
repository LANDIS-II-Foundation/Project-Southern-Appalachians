> Climate regions were selected by clustering together the growing season normals for temperature and precipitaiton. 30 yr normal values for mean
temperature and precipitaiton were gatheredfrom Prism (http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/normals/), these were summed over the growing season. 
We then preformed k-means clustering based on these values, with clusters ranging between 5 and 20. These were analyzed to see how much variance each one
encapsulated. We ultimately decided on 10 ecoregions. 
Climate models were downloaded from the MACA portls using the NKN Thredd Server, and the mean value for each day accessed for each of the twelve ecoregions. The variables used were precipitation, temperature(minimum), temperature(maximum),minimum relative humidity, maximum relative humidity,eastward wind speed, and northward wind speed.

Then we scaled the variables to be comparible 



Then preformed a kmeans clustering algrothim for both varaibles. 
We looked at the means and variances clustered within each ecoregion.



Here is the clustering with 10 ecoregions

We experimented with values from 5 to 20 ecoregions, to find the minimum number that minizied the variance while accounting for computational cost.
